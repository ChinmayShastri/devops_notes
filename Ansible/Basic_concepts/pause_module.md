# Pause Module in Ansible

## Overview
The Pause module in Ansible allows you to pause playbook execution and interactively prompt users for input or display messages during playbook execution. This is useful for implementing interactive workflows or adding pauses for manual intervention.

### Key Points to Remember
- **Purpose:** Pauses playbook execution to wait for user input or display a message.
- **Interactive:** Enables interaction within playbooks to gather information or confirm actions.
- **Usage:** Useful for implementing interactive workflows, troubleshooting, or adding manual steps.
- **Caution:** Overuse of the Pause module can disrupt automation flow and should be used judiciously.

### Example of Using Pause Module
An example playbook demonstrating the use of the Pause module:

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with Pause Module
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Pause playbook execution
      pause:
        prompt: "Press Enter to continue or Ctrl+C to abort"
```
