# `local_action` and `delegate_to` Modules in Ansible

The `local_action` and `delegate_to` modules in Ansible allow you to execute tasks on specific hosts, either locally or on a remote host different from the one defined in the playbook. These modules are useful for running certain tasks in specific environments.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **`local_action`**: Executes tasks on the control node where Ansible is running.
2. **`delegate_to`**: Executes tasks on a specified remote host rather than the target hosts of the playbook.
3. **Use Cases**: Useful for managing tasks that require running commands locally or delegating specific tasks to another host.

## Key Components in the Example

1. **Using `local_action`**: Running a task locally.
2. **Using `delegate_to`**: Delegating a task to a specific host.

## Example

### 1. Using `local_action`

Running a task locally on the control node:

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Run a local command
      local_action: command hostname
```
### 2. Using `delegate_to`
Delegating a task to a specific host:
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts from a database server
      setup:
      delegate_to: databaseserver
```
Another example, copying a file from a remote host to the local machine:
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file from remote to local
      fetch:
        src: /path/to/remote/file
        dest: /path/to/local/destination
      delegate_to: localhost
```
### 3. Combining `local_action` and `delegate_to`
Combining both directives in a playbook:
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Run a local script
      local_action:
        module: shell
        cmd: /path/to/local/script.sh

    - name: Copy a file to the load balancer
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/file
        dest: /path/to/remote/destination
      delegate_to: loadbalancer
```
## Conclusion
The `local_action` and `delegate_to` modules in Ansible provide flexibility for running tasks on specific hosts. Use `local_action` to execute tasks on the control node and `delegate_to` to run tasks on a specified remote host. These modules enhance the control and efficiency of your playbooks, allowing you to manage tasks across different environments seamlessly.
