### 1. Create Helm Chart

**Explanation:**
A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources. To create a Helm chart, you use the `helm create` command, which generates a basic chart structure with all the necessary files and directories.

Example Command:
```bash
helm create my-app
```
This command creates a directory named `my-app` containing the following structure:
- `Chart.yaml`: Metadata about the chart.
- `values.yaml`: Default configuration values for the chart.
- `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates.
- `charts/`: Directory for chart dependencies.
- `README.md`: Optional documentation about the chart.

### 2. Install Custom Chart

**Explanation:**
To install a custom Helm chart, you first need to package it if it is not already available in a Helm repository. Once packaged, you can deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster using the `helm install` command.

Example Command:
```bash
helm install my-release ./my-custom-chart
```
Here, `my-release` is the name you assign to the deployment, and `./my-custom-chart` is the path to your Helm chart directory. Helm will deploy the resources defined in the chart to your cluster.

### 3. What is Helper File, Values File, and Chart File

**Explanation:**

- **Helper File:** Helper files in Helm charts are template files that define reusable snippets of YAML. They are typically used to avoid duplication and make templates more modular. For example, `_helpers.tpl` can contain functions or template parts used by other templates in the chart.

- **Values File:** The `values.yaml` file provides default configuration values for the chart. It allows you to customize the deployment by overriding these default values. Users can pass their own values during installation or upgrades.

- **Chart File:** The `Chart.yaml` file contains metadata about the chart, such as its name, version, and description. This file is crucial for Helm to understand the chart's identity and versioning.

### 4. Package Your Helm Chart

**Explanation:**
Packaging a Helm chart creates a `.tgz` archive that contains all the files and directories needed for deployment. This archive can be stored in a Helm repository or shared with others.

Example Command:
```bash 
helm package ./my-custom-chart
```
This command creates a `.tgz` file from the `my-custom-chart` directory, which can then be uploaded to a Helm repository or shared as needed.

### 5. Validate Helm Chart

**Explanation:**
Validating a Helm chart ensures that the chart's structure and templates are correct and ready for deployment. The `helm lint` command performs this validation by checking for common issues and ensuring that the chart follows best practices.

Example Command:
```bash
helm lint ./my-custom-chart
```
This command scans the `my-custom-chart` directory for potential issues and reports any problems found. It helps ensure that your chart is in a good state before deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster.
