# What is Helm and Basic Terminologies

## What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment, management, and configuration of applications. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm uses "charts," which are pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to deploy applications in a consistent and repeatable way. 

### Key Features of Helm
- **Package Management**: Helm charts allow you to package Kubernetes resources together.
- **Version Control**: Helm keeps track of versions for your deployed applications, making it easy to roll back if necessary.
- **Configuration Management**: Helm allows you to customize your applications during deployment using configuration values.
- **Release Management**: Every deployment in Helm is called a "release." This makes it easier to manage and monitor different versions of applications.

## Basic Terminologies in Helm

### 1. **Chart**
A Helm chart is a package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. It contains all the necessary information to deploy an application, including templates, configuration files, and dependencies. Charts are reusable and can be shared using Helm repositories.

- **Components of a Chart**:
  - **Chart.yaml**: A file containing metadata about the chart (name, version, description).
  - **Values.yaml**: A file with default configuration values for the chart.
  - **Templates**: A directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates that Helm will render using the specified values.
  - **Charts**: A directory that can contain dependencies on other charts.
  - **README.md**: Optional documentation about the chart.

### 2. **Release**
A release is an instance of a Helm chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. When you use Helm to deploy a chart, Helm creates a release. Each time you install the same chart, a new release is created with its own set of resources.

### 3. **Repository**
A Helm repository is a place where charts are stored and shared. Repositories make it easy to distribute and access charts. The official Helm repository is Artifact Hub, where you can find numerous public charts for common applications.

### 4. **Values**
Values are custom configuration settings for a Helm chart. During chart installation or upgrade, you can override the default values specified in the `Values.yaml` file to customize the application deployment.

### 5. **Templates**
Templates are the Kubernetes resource files within a Helm chart. These files use the Go templating engine to allow dynamic rendering based on the values provided. Templates enable flexibility and reusability in Helm charts.

### 6. **Helm Commands**
- **helm install**: Used to deploy a chart to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **helm upgrade**: Used to update an existing release with a new chart version or configuration.
- **helm rollback**: Allows you to roll back to a previous version of a release.
- **helm uninstall**: Removes a release and its associated resources from the cluster.

## Key Points to Remember
- Helm charts provide a standardized way to package and manage Kubernetes applications.
- A release is a deployed instance of a chart.
- Helm repositories facilitate the sharing and distribution of charts.

## > Helm Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is Helm, and why is it used?
**Answer**: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment, configuration, and management of applications. It is used to package complex Kubernetes applications into charts, making deployments more consistent and easily reproducible.

### 2. What is a Helm chart?
**Answer**: A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources. It includes templates, a `Chart.yaml` file with metadata, a `Values.yaml` file for configuration, and optionally, dependencies and documentation.

### 3. What is the difference between a Helm chart and a release?
**Answer**: A Helm chart is a pre-configured package of Kubernetes resources, while a release is an instance of a chart that has been installed on a Kubernetes cluster. Each installation of a chart results in a new release with its own set of resources.

### 4. How do you override default values in a Helm chart?
**Answer**: You can override default values in a Helm chart using the `--set` flag or by providing a custom `values.yaml` file during installation. For example:
```bash
helm install my-release bitnami/nginx --set service.type=NodePort
```

### 5. What are Helm repositories, and how do you add a new one?
**Answer**: A Helm repository is a collection of charts that can be shared and distributed. You can add a new repository using the helm repo add command. For example:
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```
### 6. How does Helm handle upgrades and rollbacks?
**Answer**: Helm uses the `helm upgrade` command to apply changes to an existing release. It keeps track of the release history, allowing you to roll back to a previous version using the `helm rollback` command if something goes wrong during the upgrade.

### 7. What are templates in Helm, and how do they work?
**Answer**: Templates are Kubernetes manifest files with placeholders that use the Go templating language. They are dynamically rendered based on the values provided in the `Values.yaml` file or during installation. This allows the creation of flexible and reusable configurations for various environments.
