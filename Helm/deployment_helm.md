## 1. Helm Deployment Workflow

**Explanation:**
The Helm deployment workflow involves several steps to manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster. The typical workflow is:

1. **Create or Download a Helm Chart:** Start by creating a new chart with `helm create` or downloading an existing one.
2. **Customize Configuration:** Modify the `values.yaml` file or provide custom values using `--set` or `-f` during installation.
3. **Install the Chart:** Deploy the chart to the Kubernetes cluster using `helm install`.
4. **Upgrade the Release:** Update the chart or its configuration with `helm upgrade` to apply changes.
5. **Rollback if Necessary:** If an upgrade fails or causes issues, use `helm rollback` to revert to a previous release.
6. **Uninstall When Done:** Remove the release from the cluster with `helm uninstall` when it's no longer needed.

This workflow helps manage application lifecycle efficiently, providing mechanisms to deploy, update, and roll back applications.

## 2. Validate Resources Before Deployment

**Explanation:**
Validating resources before deployment ensures that your Helm charts are correctly defined and free from errors. The `helm lint` command checks the chart for common issues and adherence to Helm best practices.

Example Command:
```bash 
helm lint ./my-custom-chart
```

This command scans the specified chart directory for potential problems, such as syntax errors or misconfigurations, and provides feedback to address any issues before deploying.

## 3. Generate Kubernetes Deployment YAML Using Helm

**Explanation:**
Helm can generate Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) from a chart's templates without deploying them. This is useful for previewing the resources that will be created.

Example Command:
```bash
helm template my-release ./my-custom-chart
```
This command renders the Kubernetes YAML files based on the Helm chart and custom values. It outputs the manifest files to standard output, which can be redirected to a file or reviewed directly.

## 4. Get Details of Deployed Deployment

**Explanation:**
To view details about a deployed Helm release, you use the `helm status` command. This provides information about the release status, including the state of the resources and any associated events.

Example Command:
```bash
helm status my-release
```
This command shows the current status of the release named `my-release`, including information on deployments, services, and pods created by the Helm chart.

## 5. Rollback Application Using Helm

**Explanation:**
Rolling back an application using Helm allows you to revert to a previous version of a release if an upgrade introduces issues. Helm keeps a history of revisions that you can roll back to.

Example Command:
```bash
helm rollback my-release 1
```
This command reverts the release named `my-release` to revision `1`, effectively undoing changes made in subsequent upgrades.

---

## 6. Wait Helm Deployment for Successful Deployment

**Explanation:**
Waiting for a Helm deployment to complete ensures that the application is fully deployed and ready before proceeding. The `--wait` flag can be used with the `helm install` or `helm upgrade` commands to pause until all resources are successfully deployed.

Example Command:
```bash
helm install my-release ./my-custom-chart --wait
```
This command deploys the chart and waits until all Kubernetes resources are fully deployed and stable before finishing the installation process.
