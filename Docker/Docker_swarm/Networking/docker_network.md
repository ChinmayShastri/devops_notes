# Swarm Networking
## What is Swarm Networking?
- An `Overlay network` is a type of network that allows containers running on different Docker Daemon hosts to communicate with each other securely.
- Overlay Network is allow containers to communicate inside the Single Swarm.

## When you initialize a swarm two new networks are created on that Docker host:
- Ingress: Ingress is an Overlay Network, which handles control and data traffic related to swarm services.
    - If Swarm Service is not connected with user defined Overlay Network, it connect to ingress Network. 
- Bridge Network: Bridge network called `docker_gwbridge`, which connects the individual Docker node to the other node participating in the swarm.
- Docker Swarm publish Services on Some Ports and allow Outer word to access these services. This called ingress Routing mesh. 
- The routing mesh enables each node in the swarm to accept connections on published ports for any service running in the swarm, even if thereâ€™s no task running on the node. 

## Ports open to traffic to and from each Docker host participating on an overlay network:
- TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
- TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
- UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic.

### Note: 
`Before create an overlay network, docker Swarm must be initialised on Node or join it to an existing swarm.`

## Useful commands for swarm networking:
- Create an Overlay Network.
    - `#docker network create -d overlay <network_name>`
- Create Service on user Define Overlay Network
    - `#docker service create --name <Service_name> --network <network_name> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword <Image_name>`
- Create web-service to access the DB and same network
    - `#docker service create --name <service_name> --network <network_name> -p 80:80 <image_name>`
- Verify Service Published Port
    - `#docker service inspect --format="{{json .Endpoint.Spec.Ports}}" <Service_Name>`
- To Check which service is running on which node.
    - `#docker service ps $(docker service ls -q) --filter "desired-state=running" --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Name}}\t{{.Node}}"`
