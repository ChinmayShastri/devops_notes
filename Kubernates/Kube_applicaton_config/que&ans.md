###  1: What is a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?

**Answer**: A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. It allows you to separate configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.

###  2: How do you create a ConfigMap from a file?

**Answer**: You can create a ConfigMap from a file using the kubectl command:

```sh
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=my-config.txt
```

###  3: What is a Secret in Kubernetes and why is it used?

**Answer**: A Secret is an API object that stores sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Secrets are base64-encoded and allow you to keep sensitive data separate from your application code.

###  4: How can you use a ConfigMap as an environment variable in a pod?

**Answer**: You can use a ConfigMap as an environment variable by referencing it in the pod spec:

```yaml
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: example-configmap
```

###  5: How can you mount a Secret as a volume in a pod?

**Answer**: You can mount a Secret as a volume in a pod by specifying it in the volume section and the volumeMounts section of the pod spec:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: example-secret
volumeMounts:
  - name: secret-volume
    mountPath: /etc/secret
```
