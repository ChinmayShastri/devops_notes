# AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## Overview
- **Definition:** AWS EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
- **Purpose:** To provide a scalable and secure Kubernetes environment for deploying containerized applications on AWS.

## Key Features
- **Fully Managed:** AWS handles the management and scaling of the Kubernetes control plane.
- **Integration with AWS Services:** Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services such as IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, and ALB.
- **High Availability:** EKS automatically spreads the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones.
- **Security:** Integrates with AWS IAM for authentication, and supports network policies and security groups for pod security.
- **Version Upgrades:** AWS manages Kubernetes version upgrades, allowing you to stay up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

## Common Use Cases
- **Microservices:** Deploy and manage microservices architectures using Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrate with CI/CD tools to automate application deployments.
- **Hybrid Deployments:** Use EKS to manage Kubernetes clusters in both on-premises and AWS environments.
- **Big Data Processing:** Deploy and scale big data applications using Kubernetes.

## Best Practices
- **Use IAM Roles:** Assign IAM roles to service accounts for fine-grained access control.
- **Monitor with CloudWatch:** Utilize Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging Kubernetes clusters.
- **Enable Auto Scaling:** Use Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for efficient resource utilization.
- **Secure Networking:** Implement network policies and security groups to control traffic between pods.
- **Regular Backups:** Regularly back up Kubernetes manifests and persistent volumes.
