# Jenkins Pipeline Creation

## What is Jenkins Pipeline?
Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery (CD) pipelines into Jenkins. It defines the complete process of software development, from building and testing to deploying and delivering applications.

### Types of Pipelines:
1. **Declarative Pipeline**: A simplified, predefined model for creating Jenkins pipelines. It is easier to read and write.
2. **Scripted Pipeline**: Written in Groovy, provides more flexibility but is more complex compared to Declarative Pipelines.

## Why Use Jenkins Pipeline?
- Provides automation of the build, test, and deployment stages.
- Supports complex workflows.
- Can be version-controlled as code in Jenkinsfiles.

## Interview Questions and Answers:

### 1. What is Jenkins Pipeline?
**Answer**: Jenkins Pipeline is a combination of plugins that enable implementing a CD pipeline for automated software development workflows, from building to deploying applications.

### 2. What are the two types of Jenkins Pipelines?
**Answer**: Jenkins supports two types of pipelines:
- **Declarative Pipeline**: Easier to use and more structured.
- **Scripted Pipeline**: Provides more flexibility and is written in Groovy.

### 3. Why is Jenkins Pipeline preferred for CI/CD?
**Answer**: Jenkins Pipeline provides automation for the CI/CD process, allowing code to move from one stage to another in an automated, streamlined way. It also allows pipelines to be version-controlled, which provides consistency across builds.

## Jenkins Pipeline Example

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}

## Jenkins Pipeline Example Explanation

### 1. `pipeline { ... }`
This is the start of a **Declarative Pipeline**. The entire pipeline process is enclosed within these curly braces.

### 2. `agent any`
The `agent` block defines where the pipeline should run. `any` means it can run on any available Jenkins agent.

### 3. `stages { ... }`
Inside the pipeline, we define the various **stages** of the pipeline. Stages represent different steps in the CI/CD process.

### 4. `stage('Build') { ... }`
This defines the **Build** stage. The `steps` block contains the actions performed during this stage. In this case, itâ€™s an `echo` command that simulates building the application.

### 5. `stage('Test') { ... }`
The **Test** stage simulates testing the application. Like the Build stage, it uses an `echo` command to represent the testing process.

### 6. `stage('Deploy') { ... }`
The **Deploy** stage simulates deploying the application. Again, an `echo` command is used to represent deployment.

### Conclusion:
This pipeline follows a simple structure for building, testing, and deploying an application. Each stage executes in sequence, ensuring the CI/CD process is automated.
